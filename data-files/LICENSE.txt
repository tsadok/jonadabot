This code is in the public domain, because it has been released into
the public domain by its author.

In case there are jurisdictions where (contrary to all common sense)
this is not legally possible, the code is also offered under a license
that allows it to be used, modified, and redistributed without any
copyright restrictions.

Other laws that are not related to copyright still apply as usual, of
course; and the original author of the software accepts no
responsibility for actions taken by third parties.  We are each
responsible for our own actions (and those of our own bots).
