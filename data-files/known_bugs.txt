Known bugs:
 * When setting an alarm, the date is not optional.  You have to
   at least say "today", which is annoying.
 * When setting an alarm for a future date and checking via !alarms,
   the bot tells you that the alarm was set and what time but neglects
   to mention the date.  The date is set correctly; it just makes you
   nervous by not saying so.  also, the "Hmm..." (if your debug level
   is set high enough) is the only direct feedback when you set an alarm.
 * !reload has been revamped partially, but I still want to get it to
   the point where it can reload the main guts of the bot (in
   particular, handlemessage() and handlectcp()).  Currently that is
   probably not working right.  Also, I want to add the ability to
   re-initialize all the filewatch pipes, both on-demand and also on a
   schedule (because of things like logrotate).
 * jonadab_db_postgres.pl probably contains some non-working code,
   due to SQL differences between database implementations.  A test
   suite should be developed that exercises all the DB functions
   so that these issues can be discovered and fixed.

Features Wanted:
 * TODO-list management:
     !todo set Remember to blah blah blah
     !todo list (just list the id numbers of your todo items)
     !todo finished nnn (mark item #nnn as complete)
     !todo first (report the first item)
     !todo nnn (report todo item #nnn)
     !todo (report a random todo item from your set)
 * In okdom channels, answer things like "hi" or "hello"
     with a configurable channel-specific message (if set)
     or a semi-random generic greeting (otherwise).
 * Use $irc->set_nick_change_cb() to set a callback in case
   we get stuck by ournick_ or what have you, to try successive
   other nicks on our list.  This needs to store state so it
   can try each of them in turn.
 * Add a timer to check whether we have our preferred (first)
   nick, and if not periodically try to get it.   Use
   $irc->nick() and/or $irc->is_my_nick() for this.
 * Add a watch regex for demogorgon's "killed the ghost of"
     that only does anything if the ghost is from your clan.
 * Play a scrambled word game.
 * Allow recurring alarms to be set (without manually inserting database records).
 * Basic numerical calculations.
