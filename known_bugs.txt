Known bugs:
 * The new backscroll feature implementation is incomplete and does
   not yet actually do anything useful.
 * When setting an alarm, the date is not optional.  You have to
   at least say "today", which is annoying.
 * !reload has been revamped partially, but I still want to get it
   to the point where it can reload (at least most of) the guts.
   Currently that is probably not working right.  Also, I want to
   add the ability to re-initialize all the filewatch pipes, both
   on-demand and also on a schedule (because of things like logrotate).
 * The targetting on !zap is buggy: it never picks the specified target.
   I suspect this may be because the check to see if the person has been
   seen in the channel is buggy, but that's a guess.
 * Responding to CTCP requests is only partly implemented and doesn't
   actually work.  This is particularly annoying with regards to
   VERSION, because people who don't know anything about the bot
   wouldn't know about its !about trigger yet should be able to get at
   least basic information anyway.
 * After sending a /msg to the operator about a sibling bot, it
   will continue to do so every siblingminutes minutes until
   communications are re-established.  I know why this happens,
   but it is not ideal behavior.  After sending a /msg once,
   the bot should wait until it hears from the operator again
   before sending any further reminders.  Fixing this probably
   requires storing an additional variable in the database.

Features Wanted:
 * The bcc field for !sms contacts is currently not used.
 * !notifications should have an option to go ahead and send up to maxlines notifications now.
 * When biff reports a header (e.g., Subject), it should probably prefix it with box and number.
   This could be a preference, but it becomes important when there's network lag and you are
   checking on multiple messages at once.
 * Make !biff notifications do the same thing as !notifications
 * TODO-list management:
     !todo set Remember to blah blah blah
     !todo list (just list the id numbers of your todo items)
     !todo finished nnn (mark item #nnn as complete)
     !todo first (report the first item)
     !todo nnn (report todo item #nnn)
     !todo (report a random todo item from your set)
 * In okdom channels, answer things like "hi" or "hello"
     with a configurable channel-specific message (if set)
     or a semi-random generic greeting (otherwise).
 * Add a watch regex for demogorgon's "killed the ghost of"
     that only does anything if the ghost is from your clan.
 * Play a scrambled word game.
 * Allow recurring alarms to be set (without manually inserting database records).
 * Basic numerical calculations.
