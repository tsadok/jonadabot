Known bugs:
 * When setting an alarm, the date is not optional.  You have to
   at least say "today", which is annoying.
 * !reload has been revamped partially, but I still want to get it to
   the point where it can reload the main guts of the bot (in
   particular, handlemessage() and handlectcp()).  Currently that is
   probably not working right.  Also, I want to add the ability to
   re-initialize all the filewatch pipes, both on-demand and also on a
   schedule (because of things like logrotate).

Features Wanted:
 * !notifications should have an option to go ahead and send up to maxlines notifications now.
 * When biff reports a header (e.g., Subject), it should probably prefix it with box and number.
   This could be a preference, but it becomes important when there's network lag and you are
   checking on multiple messages at once.
 * Make !biff notifications do the same thing as !notifications
 * TODO-list management:
     !todo set Remember to blah blah blah
     !todo list (just list the id numbers of your todo items)
     !todo finished nnn (mark item #nnn as complete)
     !todo first (report the first item)
     !todo nnn (report todo item #nnn)
     !todo (report a random todo item from your set)
 * In okdom channels, answer things like "hi" or "hello"
     with a configurable channel-specific message (if set)
     or a semi-random generic greeting (otherwise).
 * Add a watch regex for demogorgon's "killed the ghost of"
     that only does anything if the ghost is from your clan.
 * Play a scrambled word game.
 * Allow recurring alarms to be set (without manually inserting database records).
 * Basic numerical calculations.
