Known bugs:
 * When setting an alarm, the date is not optional.  You have to
   at least say "today", which is annoying.
 * The !brownies trigger (for foodservice) is buggy.
 * !reload is buggy.  What it really should do call a
   loadconfigfromdb function that should also be used at startup,
   and maybe have options to reload extrasubs and regexes
   and possibly redo the filewatch pipes.
 * The targetting on !zap is buggy: it never picks the specified target.
   I suspect this may be because the check to see if the person has been
   seen in the channel is buggy, but that's a guess.
 * Responding to CTCP requests doesn't work.  This is particularly
   annoying with regards to VERSION, because people who don't know
   anything about the bot wouldn't know about its !about trigger
   yet should be able to get at least basic information anyway.
 * After sending a /msg to the operator about a sibling bot, it
   will continue to do so every siblingminutes minutes until
   communications are re-established.  I know why this happens,
   but it is not ideal behavior.  After sending a /msg once,
   the bot should wait until it hears from the operator again
   before sending any further reminders.  Fixing this probably
   requires storing an additional variable in the database.
 * When friendlytime() adds UTC hour and minute in parentheses,
   the minute is not zero-padded to two digits.  It should be.

Features Wanted:
 * It should be possible to configure permanent bcc for !sms
 * !notifications should have an option to go ahead and send up to maxlines notifications now.
 * When biff reports a header (e.g., Subject), it should probably prefix it with box and number.
   This could be a preference, but it becomes important when there's network lag and you are
   checking on multiple messages at once.
 * Make !biff notifications do the same thing as !notifications
 * TODO-list management:
     !todo set Remember to blah blah blah
     !todo list (just list the id numbers of your todo items)
     !todo finished nnn (mark item #nnn as complete)
     !todo first (report the first item)
     !todo nnn (report todo item #nnn)
     !todo (report a random todo item from your set)
 * In okdom channels, answer things like "hi" or "hello"
     with a configurable channel-specific message (if set)
     or a semi-random generic greeting (otherwise).
 * Add a watch regex for demogorgon's "killed the ghost of"
     that only does anything if the ghost is from your clan.
 * Play a scrambled word game.
 * Allow recurring alarms to be set (without manually inserting database records).
 * Basic numerical calculations.
