Known bugs:
 * When setting an alarm, the date is not optional.  You have to
   at least say "today", which is annoying.
 * The !brownies trigger (for foodservice) is buggy.

Features Wanted:
 * TODO-list management:
     !todo set Remember to blah blah blah
     !todo list (just list the id numbers of your todo items)
     !todo finished nnn (mark item #nnn as complete)
     !todo first (report the first item)
     !todo nnn (report todo item #nnn)
     !todo (report a random todo item from your set)
 * In okdom channels, answer things like "hi" or "hello"
     with a configurable channel-specific message (if set)
     or a semi-random generic greeting (otherwise).
 * Add a watch regex for demogorgon's "killed the ghost of"
     that only does anything if the ghost is from your clan.
 * Play a scrambled word game.
 * Implement recurring alarms.
 * Basic numerical calculations.
 * !zap
